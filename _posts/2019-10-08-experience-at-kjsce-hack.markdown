In this blog, I will be sharing my experience at KJCE Hackathon 2019. first, let me explain to you what is a hackathon and if you already know skip the next 6-7 lines

Hackathonâ€™s are of a various kind depending on time ( 24hr, 48hr, 12hr), theme (hardware, software, ML/AI), etc. hackathon are generally development based event where you have to create a working product which solves our day to day problem and it should be created within a time-bound given to you. it is a team-based event generally a team of four. I think this much intro is enough for you to understand what is a hackathon.

My team name for the Hackathon was **EUREKA** and the members were *[Nishit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishit-patel-45a8b0136/) (myself) , [Manan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manan-pandya-435215192/) , [Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-solanki-2a1227192/), [Pathik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pathik-ghugare-4b7b60191/)*. We were the only team from FY. Btech and we had gone intending to interact with seniors in the field and learn new technology instead of winning the contest. it was a 24hr Hackathon organized by [KJSCE Codecell](http://www.kjscecodecell.com).

The Coding Period begins on 5th Oct at noon and our idea was to make a Hospital Management System which was named Hospipro Using Python Libraries like Django. I was handling the Backend Development for the Website it includes tasks like creating a login page for the doctor, patient list view, updates patient profile, creating security Measures. Manan was handling Frontend tasks like creating HTML Pages, formating the Website. Ali was developing the android App Version of the Website Using Kotlin. Pathik Was given the task of Creating a Logo for the website and Documentation.

24hr seems to be more but when you execute it seems to be less. I and my team were continuously coding for 24hrs straight day and night with just a nap of 2hrs. I enjoyed the Friendly environment at the same time competitive too. loved the Hospitality of KJSCE Codecell.

Our product Hospipro included features like:
* Secure Login Portal
* Even when patients are unconscious we can scan the generated QR code from their IDs
* The ability for doctors to update patients profile with their profile picture
* The doctor can easily handle information of their patients in just one click
* Patients can also have access to their medical history

During the Hackathon, I learned that most of the team were using new technology Flask, Django, MongoDB for the backend. during the judging round, I learned the techniques to Pitch your Ideas to someone else. I would like to suggest you if you are planning to participate in your first hackathon to make some pre-preparation regarding the idea and how you are going to execute it.
