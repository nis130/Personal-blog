In this blog i will be sharing my experience at KJCE Hackathon 2019.
first let me explain to you what is hackathon and if you already know skip next 6-7 lines

Hackathon's are of various kind depending on time ( 24hr , 48hr ,12hr) , theme (hardware , software ,ML/AI) etc. hackathon are generally development based event where you have to create an working product which solves our day to day problem and it should be created within time bound given to you. it is generally team based event generally team of four. I think this much intro is enough for you to understand what is hackathon. 

My team name for the Hackathon was **EUREKA** and the members where *[Nishit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishit-patel-45a8b0136/) (myself) , [Manan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manan-pandya-435215192/) , [Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-solanki-2a1227192/), [Pathik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pathik-ghugare-4b7b60191/)*. We where the only team from FY.Btech and we had gone with a goal of intracting with seniors in the field and learning new technology instead of winning the contest.
it was 24hr Hackathon organized by [KJSCE Codecell](http://www.kjscecodecell.com).

The Coding Period begin on 5th Oct at 12:00 pm and our idea was to make a Hospital Management System which was named as Hospipro Using Python Libraries like Django. I was handaling the Backend Development for the Website it include tasks like creating login page for doctor , patient list view, update patient profile , creating security Measures. Manan was handling Frontend tasks like creating HTML Pages , formating the Website. Ali was developing the android App Version of the Website Using Kotlin. Pathik Was given task of Creating Logo for website and Documentation.

24hr seems to be more but when you actually execute it seems to be less. myself and my team was continously coding for 24hrs straight day and night with just nap of 2hrs. I enjoyed the Friendly
enviroment at the same time copetetive too. loved the Hospitality of KJSCE Codecell.

Our product Hospipro included features like:
* Secure Login Portal
* Even when patients are unconscious we can scan the genereated QR code from their IDs 
* Ability for doctors to update patients profile with their profile picture
* Doctor can easily handle information of their patients in just one click
* Patients can also have access to there medical history

During the Hackathon I learned that most of the team where using new technology Flask , Django , MongoDB for the backend. during the judging round I learned the techniques to Pitch your Ideas to someone else. I would like to suggest to the people who are going to participate in their first hackathon to make some pre preparation regarding the idea and how you are going to execute.
